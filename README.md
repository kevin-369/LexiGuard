LexiGuard | AI-Powered Legal Intelligence & Client Portal
LexiGuard is a high-end legal technology demonstration designed to bridge the gap between complex legal jargon and executive decision-making. Built with a focus on UI/UX accessibility, secure document flows, and AI-assisted workflows, it reflects my experience in digital transformation for the legal and financial sectors.

🚀 Overview
Drawing from my work with MWC Legal and Protos Capital, LexiGuard addresses the common "bounce rate" and "credibility" issues found in traditional legal portals. It utilizes the Gemini 1.5 Flash API to provide real-time risk assessments and "Plain English" summaries of complex legal documents.

Key Features

Smart Vault: A secure, drag-and-drop document exchange interface built for regulatory compliance.

AI "Plain English" Analysis: Instant translation of legalese into actionable executive summaries.

Dynamic Risk Matrix: Automated identification of high, medium, and low-priority legal risks.


ESG & Governance Tracker: A specialized module for tracking sustainability and corporate governance milestones, inspired by my work with EDGE-certified logistics projects.

🛠️ Tech Stack
This project showcases my Full Stack Development and Computer Science background:

Frontend: Next.js (App Router) with Framer Motion for high-performance animations.

Deployment: Vercel (Edge Functions for low-latency AI responses).

AI Engine: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash via Google AI Studio.

Styling: Tailwind CSS with a "Glassmorphic" design system.

🎨 Design Philosophy
Following Lean UX and Design Thinking frameworks, the UI is designed for:


Accessibility: High-contrast typography and WCAG-compliant color systems.

Micro-interactions: Spring-based transitions and "shimmer" loading states to improve perceived performance.


Responsiveness: A fluid grid system that maintains a "premium feel" across mobile and desktop.
